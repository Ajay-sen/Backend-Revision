-> Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that simplifies building web servers and APIs.

    - it lets use make request and get response from the server
    -the server keeps listening all the time for any request
    - /: home Route
      /login: login route

>> Start:
    -we start by initializing the folder  using: npm init
    -it will ask for basic details and then the package.json folder will be crated
    -add the "start" : "node index.js" command in the package.json, to run the files
    -craete a index.js file to start coding

    -now to start the backend we need express , so install it: 

    -require the express in index.js,, write the '/' home route
    -listen the port to start the server

>> env:
    -keep all the datas that need not to be shared in this file
    -for this install dotenv and create a file name .env
