>>> In this we are approaching mongoose in details.

    - these files are generally kept in models folder
    -suppose we are going to define the data for a user model and we kept the name user.js, ,but in professional field they keep this name as user.model.js...its just a convention nothing else

    -focus on the MODELS folder here
    -install mongoose to use it
    -mongoose is used to create Schemas

>> Syntax(main starting):
    -import the mongoose:
     import mongoose from "mongoose"

    -create a schema using the new keyword, and using Schema method of the mongoose: 
    const userSchema=new mongoose.Schema({})

    -expoort it to use in other sites:
    export const User=mongoose.model("User",userSchema)
        "User" is the name given to it , and it is based on the userSchema

        **IMP:  convention of of naming is first CApital, rest all small, eg: User, but it a standarised rule in mongodb that there it words gets converted to plural, and all small letters that is here: users 

        for Todo-> todos
