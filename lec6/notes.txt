This is a short crash course on HTTP:(hyper text transfer protocol)

>> http vs https:

    ->the only diff is the protocol in them , the technology or the methods in both are same
    ->http sends the exact data, while https adds a layer of encryption to the data, 

>> URL,URI,URN:
     
     -> "Uniform Resource Locator/Identifier/Name" are just the terms to get the location or something by they could be reached 

>>HTTP headers:

    -> they are metadata with the protocols, generally key: value pairs
    ->there are many fucntion where headers could be used like: caching, authentication, manage some state and many more.
    ->x-prefix: till 2012(then decrepecated)

    ->some categories of headers are:
        > Request Header: from client
        > Response header: from server
        > Representation header: encoding/compression
        > payload headers: data

    -> most common headers:
        > accept: application/json( which type of data is coming)
        > user-agent (from which platform the data is coming)
        > authorization: Bearer... (some token for authentication)
        > content-type (image/pdf. etc)
        > cookie (key:value pair)
        > cache-control

>> HTTP methods:

    -> Basic set of operations that can  be used to interact with server:

    GET: retrieve a Resource
    HEAD: No message body (response headers only)
    OPTIONS: what operations are avilable
    TRACE: loopback test (get some data)
    DELETE: remove a Resource
    PUT: replace a Resource
    POST: Interact with the resorce (mostly add data)
    PATCH: change part of a resource


>>HTTP status codes:

    1xx: informational
    2xx: success
    3xx: redirectional
    4xx: client error
    5xx: server error

    some common are (they may vary from company to comapany):

    100: continue   102: processing
    200: OK     201: created    202: accepted
    307: temporary redirect 308: permanent redirect
    400: bad request 401: unauthorized 402: payment req 404: not found
    500: inetrnal server error 504: gateway time out
